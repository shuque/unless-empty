unless_empty

If the standard input to this scirpt is non-empty it runs a specified
command line feeding out standard input to its standard input. Based
on an earlier script by ex-colleague Mark Levinson that predated the
python subprocess module.

    Usage: unless_empty command [args ...]

This is handy for use in cron jobs like the following:

check_something | unless_empty mailx -s 'something is wrong' user

--Shumon Huque
